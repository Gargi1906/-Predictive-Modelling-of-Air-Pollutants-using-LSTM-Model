# -Predictive-Modelling-of-Air-Pollutants-using-LSTM-Model
Welcome to the Predictive Modelling of Air Pollutants using LSTM Model repository! This project implements AI using Python to develop a predictive model for air pollutants, specifically utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The goal is to enhance real-time air quality monitoring in metropolitan cities and provide actionable insights for public health and environmental strategies.

# Overview
Air pollution poses significant risks to public health and the environment. This project focuses on leveraging LSTM models to predict air pollutant levels based on historical data. The model's predictions aid in understanding pollutant trends, facilitating proactive measures for air quality management.

# Key Features
1. LSTM Model Implementation: Utilizes LSTM networks for time-series prediction of air pollutant levels.

2. Data Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses air quality data for model training.

3. Google Colab Integration: Implemented and executed in Google Colab for seamless collaboration and access to GPU resources.

4. Trend Analysis: Conducts trend analysis on pollutants to identify patterns and anomalies.

5. Real-time Monitoring: Enhances real-time monitoring capabilities for immediate intervention and decision-making.

6. Python Implementation: Developed entirely in Python using libraries such as TensorFlow, pandas, and matplotlib.

# Usage
1. Open in Google Colab: Click on the "Open in Colab" badge to launch the notebook in Google Colab.

2. Run the Notebook: Execute each cell in the notebook to preprocess data, train the LSTM model, and analyze air pollutant trends.

3. Visualization: Visualize predicted pollutant levels and trend analysis results using matplotlib within the notebook.

# Screenshots,Visuals and other files
1. Graphs: Include sample graphs and visualizations generated from the LSTM model predictions.
